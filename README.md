# Implementation for SVD-softmax: Fast Softmax Approximation on Large Vocabulary Neural Networks

This is an implementation of SVD-Softmax in Tensorflow, which is presented in NIPS 2017 by Kyuhong Shim, Minjae Lee, Iksoo Choi, Yoonhoo Boo and Wonyong Sung at NIPS 2017.

The optimizer needs to be tested for NMT tasks to check evaluate its performance.
